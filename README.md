# RL from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms — from classical tabular methods to deep RL.

## Contents

- **Tabular RL**: Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, Q-Learning
- **Deep RL (PyTorch)**: DQN, PPO, etc.
- **Example Environments**: Simple custom setups and Gymnasium environments (e.g. GridWorld)

## Tools

This project is built using:

- **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)** — for building and training deep RL models
- **[Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/)** — for standard RL environments and interfaces
- **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/)** — for tabular RL and general numerical operations
